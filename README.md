<h1>Data Analysis Porject</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
For my ISE-291 data analysis project, I worked on JML business data related to car resale prices. The project aimed to explore the data and identify possible patterns and relationships in the data to estimate car resale prices. The key variable of interest was Sale_Price, and I had to assume that cars depreciating by 10% or less were high return cars, while those depreciating by 20% or more were low return cars.
<br />


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<b>The analysis was performed using the following technologies and packages:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Python</b></li>
    <li><b>Pandas</b> for data manipulation and analysis </li>
    <li><b>Seaborn</b> and <b>Matplotlib</b> for data visualization</li>
    <li><b>Scikit-Learn</b> for machine learning models</li>
 </ul>
  

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for interactive coding and data analysis.</b>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>
  To run the analysis, simply open the Jupyter Notebook Project-G0801-F.ipynb and run the cells sequentially. Do not forget to also download the data files and change their directory in the code to were you saved them.
